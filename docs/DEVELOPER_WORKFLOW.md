## üöÄ Development Setup

### Cross-Compilation Toolchain (Required for v1.3.0+)

```bash
# Install cross-compilation tools (macOS)
brew install musl-cross mingw-w64 cmake

# Add Rust targets
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu

# Verify .cargo/config.toml exists with proper linker configuration
```

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/holdennguyen/aws-assume-role.git
cd aws-assume-role

# Build and test
cargo build --release
cargo test  # Should pass all 79 tests

# Test cross-platform builds
./scripts/build-releases.sh
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Standard Quality Gates

### The Pre-Commit Script: Your Quality Guarantee

To ensure consistency and prevent CI failures, this project uses a standard pre-commit script that automates all essential quality checks. **Running this script is the required workflow before every commit.**

```bash
# Run the standard quality checks before you commit
./scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh
```

For convenience, you can also install this as a Git hook to run automatically on every `git commit`.

```bash
# Optional: Install as a Git hook for automatic checks
cp scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### What the Script Validates

The `scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh` script is the single source of truth for project quality. It provides clear pass/fail feedback on:

```bash
üìù Checking code formatting...        # cargo fmt --check
üîç Running clippy linting...          # cargo clippy -- -D warnings  
üß™ Running tests...                   # cargo test (all 79 tests)
üèóÔ∏è Checking build...                 # cargo build --release
```

If the script fails, it will provide instructions on how to fix the issue. You must fix the problem and re-run the script until it passes before committing.

### Benefits of the Standard Workflow

‚úÖ **Prevents CI Failures**: Catches formatting, linting, and build issues locally.  
‚úÖ **Saves Development Time**: No more waiting for CI to fail on trivial errors.  
‚úÖ **Guarantees Consistency**: Enforces the same quality standards for all contributors.  
‚úÖ **Simplifies Workflow**: One command to run all necessary checks.

## üîÑ Daily Development Flow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

Start from an up-to-date `main` branch.

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/your-new-feature
```

### 2. Write Code and Tests

Implement your changes, adding or updating tests as you go.

### 3. Run Quality Checks

Frequently run the pre-commit script to ensure your changes meet project standards.

```bash
./scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh
```

If the script finds an issue, follow its instructions to fix it. For example:

```bash
# Script fails with a formatting error
‚ùå Code formatting issues found!
üí° Fix with: cargo fmt

# Fix the issue and re-run the script
cargo fmt
./scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh

# ‚úÖ All quality checks passed!
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Once all quality checks pass, commit your work.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: A descriptive commit message"
```

### 5. Prepare for Pull Request

When your feature is complete, rebase on `main` and run the quality checks one last time before pushing.

```bash
git pull --rebase origin main
./scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh
```

### 6. Push and Create Pull Request

Push your branch and open a pull request in GitHub.

```bash
git push origin feature/your-new-feature
```

## üß™ Testing & Quality Gates

### Test Suite Structure (79 Tests Total)

- **Unit Tests**: 23 tests (core functionality)
- **Integration Tests**: 14 tests (AWS integration)
- **Shell Integration**: 19 tests (universal wrapper)
- **Additional Tests**: 23 tests (utilities)

### Quality Standards (Zero Tolerance)

```bash
# These MUST pass before any commit
cargo fmt --check                  # Zero formatting violations
cargo clippy -- -D warnings       # Zero linting warnings
cargo test                         # 100% test success rate
cargo audit                        # Zero security vulnerabilities
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Formatting Issue Prevention

The most common CI failure is code formatting. The standard workflow is designed to prevent this entirely.

**The Correct Workflow**:
```bash
# 1. Edit code.
# 2. Run the quality script. It will fail if formatting is incorrect.
./scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh
#
# ‚ùå Code formatting issues found!
# üí° Fix with: cargo fmt

# 3. Fix the formatting and re-run the script.
cargo fmt
./scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh
#
# üéâ All quality checks passed!

# 4. Commit your changes.
git add . && git commit
```
This process guarantees that no unformatted code is ever pushed, preventing CI failures.

### üîß Pre-Commit Script Usage

**Standard Method: Manual Execution**
The standard workflow is to run the script manually before each commit. This gives you full control.
```bash
./scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh
```

**Optional Convenience: Git Hook Installation**
For convenience, you can install the script as a Git hook so it runs automatically when you type `git commit`.
```bash
cp scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```
If you need to bypass the hook for a specific reason, you can use `git commit --no-verify`.

**When the Script Catches Issues**:
The script provides clear feedback on what failed and how to fix it.
```bash
./scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh
# üîç Running pre-commit quality checks...
# üìù Checking code formatting...
# ‚ùå Code formatting issues found!
# üí° Fix with: cargo fmt

# Fix the issue as suggested:
cargo fmt

# Then re-run the script to confirm the fix:
./scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh
# üéâ All quality checks passed!
```

## üéØ Safe Release Process (CRITICAL)

### The "Release from Develop" Workflow Philosophy

This project uses a **GitFlow-like** branching model where releases are tagged from the `develop` branch *before* merging into `main`. This is a deliberate and robust strategy.

**Branch Roles:**
- **`develop`**: The integration branch for the "next release." All CI checks run here.
- **`main`**: The production branch. It only contains code from successfully completed releases.
- **`tags` (e.g., `v1.3.0`)**: Immutable pointers to a specific commit on `develop` that represents a formal, published release.

**Why Release Before Merging to `main`?**
- ‚úÖ **Maximum Confidence**: The release is built from the *exact* commit that passed all CI checks on `develop`, eliminating any chance of last-minute issues.
- ‚úÖ **`main` is Always Production-Ready**: The `main` branch is a clean, stable history of official releases. You can trust it completely.
- ‚úÖ **Clear Automation Trigger**: A Git tag is the perfect, unambiguous trigger for the automated release pipeline.
- ‚úÖ **Decoupled Process**: It separates the *act of releasing* from the *act of updating the production branch*. The merge to `main` is a simple, safe finalization step.

### Visual Workflow

    subgraph "Finalization"
        G -->|Release Success ‚úÖ| H(Merge 'develop' to 'main')
        H --> I[Push 'main']
    end
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULE: Never Tag Before CI Passes

The GitHub Actions workflow can fail for various reasons. **ALWAYS** wait for CI validation before creating release tags.

### Phase 1: Prepare Release

```bash
# 1. Prepare release with unified script
./scripts/release.sh prepare 1.3.0

# This automatically:
# - Updates version in Cargo.toml
# - Creates/updates release notes
# - Validates version consistency
# - Stages changes for commit
```

### Phase 2: Push and Wait for CI ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

```bash
# 2. Commit and push to develop (NOT main, NOT tagged yet)
git add . && git commit -m "üîñ Prepare release v1.3.0"
git push origin develop

# 3. CRITICAL: Wait for GitHub Actions to PASS
# Visit: https://github.com/holdennguyen/aws-assume-role/actions
# 
# Wait for ALL these to complete successfully:
# ‚úÖ Code Quality & Testing (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)
# ‚úÖ Cross-Platform Build (Linux musl, macOS, Windows)
# ‚úÖ Security Audit (advisory but should complete)
# 
# DO NOT proceed until you see: ‚úÖ All checks have passed
```

### Phase 3: Create Release Tag

```bash
# 4. ONLY after CI passes, create and push tag
git tag -a v1.3.0 -m "Release v1.3.0

üöÄ Major Release: Cross-Platform Build Infrastructure

Key Features:
- Cross-compilation toolchain setup
- Universal bash wrapper for all platforms
- Automated build pipeline
- Enhanced test suite (79 tests)"

git push origin v1.3.0
```

### Phase 4: Finalize the Release (Merge to Main)

After the tag is pushed, the automated release pipeline will run. **Once you confirm the release was successful**, the final step is to merge the `develop` branch into `main` to bring the production branch up to date.

```bash
# 1. Switch to the main branch and pull latest changes
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Merge the develop branch into main
git merge develop

# 3. Push the updated main branch
git push origin main
```

### Phase 5: Automated Release Pipeline

The tag push triggers the full automated release pipeline:

1. **GitHub Release**: Automatic creation with binaries
2. **Cargo Publishing**: If `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` available
3. **Homebrew Update**: If `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` available
4. **Container Images**: Multi-platform Docker images
5. **Distribution Packages**: tar.gz/zip with checksums

### ‚ùå What NOT to Do

```bash
# WRONG - This can cause failed releases
git tag v1.3.0 && git push origin v1.3.0  # DON'T DO THIS

# WRONG - Tagging without CI validation
./scripts/release.sh prepare 1.3.0
git add . && git commit -m "Release v1.3.0"
git tag v1.3.0 && git push origin v1.3.0  # DANGEROUS

# RIGHT - Safe release process
./scripts/release.sh prepare 1.3.0
git add . && git commit -m "üîñ Prepare release v1.3.0"
git push origin develop                    # Push first
# Wait for ‚úÖ GitHub Actions success
git tag v1.3.0 && git push origin v1.3.0  # Then tag
```

## ü§ñ GitHub Actions Integration

### Workflow Triggers

- **Every Push/PR**: Quality gates (tests, clippy, format)
- **Push to main/develop**: + Cross-platform builds + Security audit
- **Tag push (v*)**: + Full release pipeline

### Monitoring Workflows

```bash
# Check recent workflow runs (requires gh auth login)
gh run list --limit 5

# Watch current workflow
gh run watch

# View failed run details
gh run view <run-id> --log
```

### Common CI Failures and Fixes

| Failure Type | Common Cause | Fix | Prevention |
|-------------|--------------|-----|------------|
| **Format Check** | Unformatted code | `cargo fmt` | **ALWAYS** run `cargo fmt` after code changes |
| Clippy Warnings | Linting violations | `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` | Run clippy during development |
| Test Failures | Broken functionality | Fix code, `cargo test` | Write tests first, run frequently |
| Cross-Compilation | Missing toolchain | Install musl-cross, mingw-w64 | Verify toolchain setup |
| Missing Files | Incomplete build | Ensure all required files exist | Run build scripts before push |

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Release Process Issues

**Problem**: GitHub Actions failed after pushing to develop
```bash
# Solution: Fix issues and push again (don't tag yet)
cargo fmt && cargo clippy -- -D warnings && cargo test
git add . && git commit -m "fix: resolve CI issues"
git push origin develop
# Wait for ‚úÖ success, then proceed with tagging
```

**Problem**: Accidentally tagged before CI passed
```bash
# Solution: Remove tag and restart process
git tag -d v1.3.0                    # Delete local tag
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.3.0    # Delete remote tag
# Fix issues, push to develop, wait for CI, then re-tag
```

### Cross-Compilation Issues

**Problem**: Linux musl build fails
```bash
# Check toolchain installation
brew list musl-cross
rustup target list --installed | grep musl

# Reinstall if needed
brew reinstall musl-cross
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```

**Problem**: Windows cross-compilation fails
```bash
# Check MinGW installation
brew list mingw-w64
rustup target list --installed | grep windows-gnu

# Reinstall if needed
brew reinstall mingw-w64
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

### Test Failures

**Problem**: Shell integration tests fail
```bash
# Ensure universal wrapper exists
ls -la releases/aws-assume-role-bash.sh

# Rebuild if missing
./scripts/build-releases.sh

# Test wrapper manually
source ./releases/aws-assume-role-bash.sh
awsr --version
```
