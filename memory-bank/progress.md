### v1.0.2 Complete Release (June 20, 2025)
**Comprehensive Package**: Windows Git Bash fix + GitHub Packages + Version Consistency
- **Core Fix**: Resolved Windows Git Bash IMDS timeout issue
  - Problem: 1-second timeout when AWS SDK tried to connect to EC2 metadata service
  - Solution: Intelligent region handling with us-east-1 default when no region configured
  - Impact: Instant credential switching on Windows Git Bash
- **GitHub Packages Integration**: 
  - Docker container support via GitHub Container Registry
  - Automated publishing workflow for containers
  - Multi-tag strategy for semantic versioning
- **Version Consistency**: 
  - Fixed all package manager versions to match v1.0.2
  - Created automated version update script
  - Dynamic GitHub Actions workflow for version-based naming
- **Files Modified**: Core application, all package configs, CI/CD, documentation
- **Distribution**: Available via GitHub Releases, GitHub Packages, Homebrew, Cargo, and all package managers

### v1.1.0 Ready for Release (Tested ✅)
**Enhanced User Experience**: Prerequisites verification + improved help system
- **Prerequisites Verification**: ✅ TESTED
  - Built-in `verify` command for checking AWS CLI, credentials, and role permissions
  - Automatic role testing during configuration with user prompts
  - Comprehensive troubleshooting guidance
  - Verbose mode for detailed verification steps
  - Specific role testing capabilities
- **Improved CLI Help**: ✅ TESTED
  - Enhanced help text with clear examples for all commands
  - Better explanation of `aws-assume-role` vs `awsr` commands
  - Detailed command descriptions and use cases
  - Prerequisites explanation in help system
- **Documentation**: ✅ COMPLETED
  - Added comprehensive PREREQUISITES.md guide
  - Updated README with enhanced troubleshooting section
  - Improved wrapper script explanations
- **Local Testing Results**: ✅ ALL FEATURES WORKING
  - Help system: Perfect command explanations and examples
  - Verification: Correctly detects AWS CLI, identifies credential issues
  - Configuration: Interactive prompts and role testing work
  - Wrapper integration: Commands pass through correctly
  - Error handling: Provides actionable troubleshooting guidance
- **Files Modified**: CLI module, AWS module, documentation, wrapper scripts
- **Documentation Consolidation**: ✅ COMPLETED
  - Created unified DISTRIBUTION.md (enterprise deployment + containers)
  - Enhanced README.md with container usage and improved troubleshooting
  - Removed 4 redundant documentation files
  - Achieved clean 4-file documentation structure
  - Eliminated content duplication across multiple files

## Known Issues
- Minor warnings about unused SSO client code (future enhancement)
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: Windows Git Bash IMDS timeout issue (fixed in v1.0.2)
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: Version inconsistencies across package managers (fixed in v1.0.2)
- ✅ **RESOLVED**: Crates.io publishing conflicts (resolved with v1.0.2)
- No current blocking issues

## Evolution of Project Decisions
1. **AWS SDK Version**: Started with latest v1.x but moved to v0.56.1 for better compatibility
2. **Region Handling**: Simplified to use environment variables rather than explicit configuration
3. **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error types for better user experience
4. **Configuration Storage**: Uses JSON format in user's home directory for simplicity
5. **CLI Design**: Chose subcommand structure for clear separation of functionality

## Next Steps (Optional)
The application is complete for the core use case. Future enhancements could include:
1. SSO integration for direct authentication
2. Shell integration scripts for easier usage
3. Credential caching for better performance
4. MFA support for enhanced security
