# Project Progress

## Current Status
The AWS Assume Role application has been successfully implemented and is now fully functional. All core features have been completed and tested.

## What Works
- ✅ Project structure initialized with Rust
- ✅ Core modules implemented (CLI, AWS, Config, Error)
- ✅ Configuration management for storing role configurations
- ✅ CLI interface with comprehensive commands
- ✅ AWS SDK integration for role assumption
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility (builds successfully)
- ✅ Error handling and logging framework
- ✅ JSON and shell export formats
- ✅ Release build optimization

## Completed Features

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅
1. Development Environment ✅
   - ✅ Rust project initialization
   - ✅ AWS SDK integration
   - ✅ Development tooling setup

2. Core Architecture ✅
   - ✅ CLI framework with clap
   - ✅ AWS authentication module
   - ✅ Role management system
   - ✅ Configuration storage

3. Basic Functionality ✅
   - ✅ Role configuration storage
   - ✅ Role assumption logic
   - ✅ Credential output formatting

### Phase 2: Features ✅
1. User Experience ✅
   - ✅ Command interface (configure, assume, list, remove)
   - ✅ Configuration validation
   - ✅ Clear error messages

2. AWS Integration ✅
   - ✅ STS assume role functionality
   - ✅ Credential management
   - ✅ Session token handling

3. Output Formats ✅
   - ✅ Shell export format
   - ✅ JSON format
   - ✅ Environment variable export

## Commands Available
- `configure`: Add/update role configurations
- `assume`: Assume a configured role and output credentials
- `list`: List all configured roles
- `remove`: Remove a role configuration

## What's Left to Build

### Optional Enhancements
1. SSO Integration
   - [ ] Direct SSO authentication flow
   - [ ] SSO token management
   - [ ] Automatic SSO refresh

2. Advanced Features
   - [ ] Role chaining support
   - [ ] MFA support
   - [ ] Profile integration with AWS CLI
   - [ ] Credential caching

3. User Experience Improvements
   - [ ] Interactive configuration wizard
   - [ ] Shell integration scripts
   - [ ] Auto-completion support

## Current Status Summary
The application is **production-ready** with all core functionality implemented:
- Users can configure IAM roles
- Users can assume roles and get temporary credentials
- Credentials are output in both shell and JSON formats
- Configuration is persisted across sessions
- Error handling provides clear feedback

## Known Issues
- Minor warnings about unused SSO client code (future enhancement)
- No current blocking issues

## Evolution of Project Decisions
1. **AWS SDK Version**: Started with latest v1.x but moved to v0.56.1 for better compatibility
2. **Region Handling**: Simplified to use environment variables rather than explicit configuration
3. **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error types for better user experience
4. **Configuration Storage**: Uses JSON format in user's home directory for simplicity
5. **CLI Design**: Chose subcommand structure for clear separation of functionality

## Next Steps (Optional)
The application is complete for the core use case. Future enhancements could include:
1. SSO integration for direct authentication
2. Shell integration scripts for easier usage
3. Credential caching for better performance
4. MFA support for enhanced security
