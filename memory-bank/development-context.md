### **Current Streamlined Architecture (v1.3.0)**

**Cross-Compilation Infrastructure**:
- `musl-cross` toolchain for Linux static builds
- `mingw-w64` toolchain for Windows cross-compilation  
- `cmake` for native dependencies
- `.cargo/config.toml` with proper linker configuration
- Rust targets: `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`

**Developer Tooling (4 core components)**:
1. `./dev-cli.sh` - **NEW**: The unified developer script for all tasks. This is the primary entry point for developers.
2. `scripts/release.sh` - Streamlined backend for release preparation and local packaging
3. `releases/INSTALL.sh` - Distribution installer for end-users.
4. `releases/UNINSTALL.sh` - Clean uninstaller for end-users.

**Documentation (4 core files)**:
1. `README.md` - Central navigation hub
2. `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` - Installation & deployment guide
3. `docs/DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md` - Complete development guide (updated with correct Git Flow)
4. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical architecture

**GitHub Actions**: Single `ci-cd.yml` with smart triggers and unified pipeline

### **üéØ Real-World Success Story: Windows CI Fix (Dec 2024)**

**Problem**: Windows CI compilation failure due to Unix-specific file permissions code
```rust
// Failed on Windows CI:
use std::os::unix::fs::PermissionsExt;  // ‚ùå Unix-only module
let mode = permissions.mode();          // ‚ùå Unix-only method
```

**Detection**: Developer CLI caught formatting issues before push
```bash
./dev-cli.sh check
# üîç Running pre-commit quality checks...
# ‚ùå Code formatting issues found!
# üí° Fix with: cargo fmt
```

**Solution**: Cross-platform conditional compilation
```rust
// Fixed with platform-specific compilation:
#[cfg(unix)]
fn test_unix_executable_permissions() { /* Unix-specific code */ }

#[cfg(windows)]  
fn test_windows_file_existence() { /* Windows-compatible code */ }
```

**Outcome**: 
- ‚úÖ Developer CLI prevented CI failure by catching formatting early
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform compatibility maintained
- ‚úÖ All 79 tests pass on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- ‚úÖ Safe release process validated - no broken CI pipeline

**Key Learning**: A unified developer CLI (`./dev-cli.sh`) is essential for maintaining quality and simplifying cross-platform development.

## üîÑ The Standard Development Workflow (v1.3.0)

The entire development lifecycle is managed through the `./dev-cli.sh` script, as documented in `docs/DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md`.

### üìã Phase 1: Daily Development

**The Standard Cycle:**
```bash
# 1. Start a new feature branch
git checkout main && git pull && git checkout -b feature/your-feature

# 2. Implement changes and add tests

# 3. CRITICAL: Run the standard quality checks before every commit
./dev-cli.sh check

# 4. Commit when all checks pass
git add . && git commit -m "feat: your descriptive commit message"

# 5. Push and create a pull request to 'develop'
git push origin feature/your-feature
```

### üéØ Phase 2: The SAFE Release Workflow

This workflow begins after all features for a release have been merged into the `develop` branch.

**The Official Release Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Prepare the release with the unified script
./dev-cli.sh release <version>

# 2. Commit the version bump and push to 'develop' to trigger CI
git add . && git commit -m "üîñ Prepare release v<version>"
git push origin develop

# 3. CRITICAL: Wait for GitHub Actions to PASS on 'develop'.

# 4. ONLY after CI passes, create and push the release tag
git tag -a v<version> -m "Release v<version>"
git push origin v<version>

# 5. Finalize by merging 'develop' into 'main'
git checkout main && git merge develop && git push
```

**CRITICAL PATTERN: Never Tag Before CI Passes**
The entire safety of the workflow depends on this rule. Pushing a tag to `develop` before CI has validated the commit can lead to a broken release.

### **Cross-Platform Validation**
To ensure your changes work on all target operating systems, you can build the binaries locally.

```bash
# Build all cross-platform binaries
./dev-cli.sh build

# Verify the binaries were created
ls -l releases/aws-assume-role-*
```

### **Local Distribution Testing**
Before creating an official release, you can test the complete end-to-end user experience locally.

```bash
# Create a full distributable package for testing
./dev-cli.sh package <version>

# This creates releases/dist/ with .tar.gz and .zip archives
# Test the installation process with these local artifacts
```

**CRITICAL PATTERN: Developer CLI Usage**
- The `./dev-cli.sh check` command is the **single source of truth** for code quality.
- It prevents CI failures by running the exact same checks locally.
- It must be run before every commit.
- The command will automatically fix formatting issues and report any other errors.

## üéØ Critical Development Patterns (Enhanced v1.3.0)

### **CRITICAL: Safe Release Pattern (NEW)**
```bash
# The ONLY safe way to release:
# 1. Prepare release locally
./dev-cli.sh release <version>

# 2. Push to develop and WAIT for CI
git add . && git commit -m "üîñ Prepare release v<version>"
git push origin develop

# 3. Check GitHub Actions status
# Visit: https://github.com/holdennguyen/aws-assume-role/actions
# Wait for ‚úÖ All checks have passed

# 4. ONLY after CI success, create tag
git tag -a v<version> -m "Release v<version>"
git push origin v<version>

# 5. Tag triggers automated release pipeline
```

### **CRITICAL: Cross-Compilation Toolchain Pattern**
```bash
# Complete toolchain setup required for consistent builds
# 1. Install native tools
brew install musl-cross mingw-w64 cmake

# 2. Add Rust targets
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu

# 3. Configure linkers in .cargo/config.toml
[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-musl]
linker = "x86_64-linux-musl-gcc"

[target.x86_64-pc-windows-gnu]
linker = "x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc"

# 4. Set environment variables for cross-compilation
export CC_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl=x86_64-linux-musl-gcc
export AR_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl=x86_64-linux-musl-ar
export CC_x86_64_pc_windows_gnu=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc
export AR_x86_64_pc_windows_gnu=x86_64-w64-mingw32-ar

# 5. Build with unified command
./dev-cli.sh build
```

### **Universal Wrapper Development Pattern**
```bash
# Single wrapper script approach (major simplification from v1.2.x)
# File: releases/aws-assume-role-bash.sh

# Platform detection pattern:
case "$(uname -s)" in
    Linux*)     os_type="linux" ;;
    Darwin*)    os_type="macos" ;;
    MINGW*|MSYS*|CYGWIN*) os_type="windows" ;;
    *)          echo "Unsupported operating system" >&2; exit 1 ;;
esac

# Binary selection pattern:
local binary_name="aws-assume-role-$os_type"
if [ "$os_type" = "windows" ]; then
    binary_name="aws-assume-role-windows.exe"
fi

# Role assumption pattern:
if [ "$1" = "assume" ]; then
    eval $("$binary_path" assume "$2" "${@:3}" --format export)
else
    "$binary_path" "$@"
fi
```

### **CRITICAL: Quality Gate Pattern**
```bash
# The developer CLI is the single quality gate
./dev-cli.sh check

# This command:
# 1. Formats code automatically (cargo fmt)
# 2. Runs linting (cargo clippy -- -D warnings)
# 3. Runs all tests (cargo test)
# 4. Validates build (cargo build --release)
# 5. Provides clear feedback on any issues

# MUST be run before every commit to prevent CI failures
```

### **Local Distribution Testing Pattern**
```bash
# Create full distributable package for end-to-end testing
./dev-cli.sh package <version>

# This creates:
# - releases/dist/aws-assume-role-cli-v<version>.tar.gz
# - releases/dist/aws-assume-role-cli-v<version>.zip
# - SHA256 checksums for both archives
# - All required binaries and scripts

# Test the complete user experience:
# 1. Extract the archive
# 2. Run the installer
# 3. Test the awsr command
# 4. Verify role assumption works
```

## üîß Development Environment Setup

### **Required Tools (macOS)**
```bash
# Install cross-compilation toolchain
brew install musl-cross mingw-w64 cmake

# Add Rust targets
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu

# Verify setup
rustup target list --installed | grep -E "(musl|windows-gnu)"
```

### **Development Commands Reference**
```bash
# Quality checks (run before every commit)
./dev-cli.sh check

# Build binaries for all platforms
./dev-cli.sh build

# Create local distribution package for testing
./dev-cli.sh package <version>

# Prepare for release
./dev-cli.sh release <version>

# Show help
./dev-cli.sh help
```
