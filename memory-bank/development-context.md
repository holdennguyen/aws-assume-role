- ‚úÖ **Windows CI Fix**: Cross-platform test compatibility resolved with conditional compilation

### **Current Streamlined Architecture (v1.3.0)**

**Cross-Compilation Infrastructure**:
- `musl-cross` toolchain for Linux static builds
- `mingw-w64` toolchain for Windows cross-compilation  
- `cmake` for native dependencies
- `.cargo/config.toml` with proper linker configuration
- Rust targets: `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`

**Scripts (6 total)**:
1. `scripts/build-releases.sh` - Cross-platform builds with toolchain
2. `scripts/release.sh` - Unified release management (507 lines)
3. `scripts/install.sh` - Universal installer (355 lines)
4. `scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh` - **NEW**: Automated quality gates (prevents CI failures)
5. `releases/INSTALL.sh` - Distribution installer (direct binary)
6. `releases/UNINSTALL.sh` - Clean uninstaller

**Documentation (4 core files)**:
1. `README.md` - Central navigation hub
2. `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` - Installation & deployment guide
3. `docs/DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md` - Complete development guide
4. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical architecture

**GitHub Actions**: Single `ci-cd.yml` with smart triggers and unified pipeline

### **üéØ Real-World Success Story: Windows CI Fix (Dec 2024)**

**Problem**: Windows CI compilation failure due to Unix-specific file permissions code
```rust
// Failed on Windows CI:
use std::os::unix::fs::PermissionsExt;  // ‚ùå Unix-only module
let mode = permissions.mode();          // ‚ùå Unix-only method
```

**Detection**: Pre-commit script caught formatting issues before push
```bash
./scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh
# üîç Running pre-commit quality checks...
# ‚ùå Code formatting issues found!
# üí° Fix with: cargo fmt
```

**Solution**: Cross-platform conditional compilation
```rust
// Fixed with platform-specific compilation:
#[cfg(unix)]
fn test_unix_executable_permissions() { /* Unix-specific code */ }

#[cfg(windows)]  
fn test_windows_file_existence() { /* Windows-compatible code */ }
```

**Outcome**: 
- ‚úÖ Pre-commit script prevented CI failure by catching formatting early
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform compatibility maintained
- ‚úÖ All 79 tests pass on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- ‚úÖ Safe release process validated - no broken CI pipeline

**Key Learning**: Pre-commit script is essential for cross-platform development

## üîÑ The Standard Development Workflow (v1.3.0)

### **The "Safe Release Process"**

This process, enforced by the `DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md` and the `release.sh` script, is the required method for creating new releases. It is designed to be robust and prevent broken releases.

**Core Principles**:
1.  **Single Quality Gate**: `scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh` is the one command to run for all local validation.
2.  **Release from `develop`**: The `develop` branch is the integration point for releases.
3.  **CI Before Tagging**: A release tag is **only** created after all checks have passed on the `develop` branch.
4.  **`master` is Production**: The `master` branch contains the history of successful, tagged releases.

### **üìã Phase 1: Feature Development**

**The Standard Daily Cycle:**
```bash
# 1. Start from a clean master branch
git checkout master && git pull origin master
git checkout -b feature/your-feature

# 2. Implement your changes and add tests

# 3. Run the standard quality checks
#    This is the only validation command you need.
./scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh

# 4. Commit when all checks pass
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your descriptive commit message"

# 5. Push and create a pull request to the 'develop' branch
git push origin feature/your-feature
```

### **üéØ Phase 2: The SAFE Release Workflow**

This workflow begins after all features for a release have been merged into the `develop` branch.

**The Official Release Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Prepare the release with the unified script
#    This updates the version in Cargo.toml and other files.
./scripts/release.sh prepare 1.3.0

# 2. Commit the version bump
git add . && git commit -m "üîñ Prepare release v1.3.0"

# 3. Push to the 'develop' branch to trigger CI
git push origin develop

# 4. CRITICAL: Wait for GitHub Actions to PASS
#    Do not proceed until all checks are green for your commit on the 'develop' branch.

# 5. ONLY after CI passes, create and push the release tag
git tag -a v1.3.0 -m "Release v1.3.0"
git push origin v1.3.0

# The tag push triggers the automated release pipeline in GitHub Actions.

# 6. Finalize by merging 'develop' into 'master'
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git merge develop
git push origin master
```

**CRITICAL PATTERN: Never Tag Before CI Passes**
The entire safety of the workflow depends on this rule. Pushing a tag to `develop` before CI has validated the commit can lead to a broken release.

```bash
# WRONG:
git push origin develop && git push origin v1.3.0 # Pushing tag immediately is dangerous

# RIGHT:
git push origin develop
# ... wait for CI ...
git push origin v1.3.0 # Push tag only after CI passes
```

### **üìã Phase 1: Feature Development (Enhanced)**

**Daily Development Cycle with Cross-Compilation:**
```bash
# 1. Start with clean environment
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature

# 2. Test-Driven Development
# - Write failing tests first
# - Implement incrementally
# - Keep commits focused

# 3. RECOMMENDED: Pre-Commit Script (ENHANCED v1.3.0)
./scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh        # ‚úÖ Comprehensive quality gates in one command

# Alternative manual approach (more error-prone):
cargo fmt                          # Format code (ZERO TOLERANCE)
cargo clippy -- -D warnings        # Linting (ZERO TOLERANCE)
cargo test                         # All 79 tests must pass
cargo test --test integration_tests # Integration validation
cargo test --test shell_integration_tests # Shell wrapper validation

# 4. Cross-platform validation (enhanced)
./scripts/build-releases.sh        # Build all platforms with toolchain
./releases/aws-assume-role-macos --version
./releases/aws-assume-role-linux --version
./releases/aws-assume-role-windows.exe --version

# 5. Test universal wrapper
source ./releases/aws-assume-role-bash.sh
awsr --version                     # Test convenience alias
```

**CRITICAL PATTERN: Cross-Compilation Setup**
```bash
# Ensure cross-compilation toolchain is available
brew install musl-cross mingw-w64 cmake  # macOS setup

# Add Rust targets if not present
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu

# Verify .cargo/config.toml has proper linker configuration
# Must have CC and AR environment variables for cross-compilation
```

**CRITICAL PATTERN: Pre-Commit Script Usage (NEW - v1.3.0)**
```bash
# RECOMMENDED: Use pre-commit script for all changes
# Prevents CI failures by catching issues locally
# Successfully prevented Windows CI failure in v1.3.0 release

# After ANY code change:
./scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh        # ‚úÖ Comprehensive validation
# If all checks pass:
git add . && git commit -m "feat: your change"

# Real example from v1.3.0:
# Problem: Windows CI failed on Unix-specific permissions code
# Detection: Pre-commit script caught formatting issue before push
# Solution: Fixed formatting, re-ran script, successful commit
```

**LEGACY PATTERN: Manual Formatting (Error-Prone)**
```bash
# Alternative manual approach (more error-prone):
# ANY code modification requires immediate formatting
# CI has ZERO TOLERANCE for formatting violations

# After ANY code change:
cargo fmt                          # MANDATORY - never skip this
git add . && git commit -m "feat: your change"
```

**Pull Request Workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Pre-PR checklist (ENHANCED v1.3.0)
git rebase main                     # Clean history
./scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh        # ‚úÖ Comprehensive quality gates
./scripts/build-releases.sh        # Cross-platform build validation

# Alternative manual approach (more error-prone):
cargo test                         # All 79 tests pass (expanded from 59)
cargo fmt && cargo clippy -- -D warnings # Code quality gates

# 2. Create PR to main branch
# Title: Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
# Description: Link issues, describe changes, testing done
# CI will run comprehensive validation automatically

# 3. Address review feedback and re-validate
```

### **üéØ Phase 2: SAFE Release Process (CRITICAL - Updated v1.3.0)**

**SAFE Release Workflow - ALWAYS Wait for CI:**
```bash
# 1. Prepare release with unified script
./scripts/release.sh prepare 1.3.0

# This automatically:
# - Updates version in Cargo.toml
# - Creates release notes from template
# - Validates version consistency
# - Stages changes for commit

# 2. Commit and push to develop (NOT main, NOT tagged yet)
git add . && git commit -m "üîñ Prepare release v1.3.0"
git push origin develop

# 3. CRITICAL: Wait for GitHub Actions to PASS
# Check GitHub Actions status at: https://github.com/holdennguyen/aws-assume-role/actions
# - Quality gates must pass (tests, clippy, format)
# - Cross-platform builds must succeed
# - Security audit should complete (advisory)
# 
# DO NOT proceed until you see: ‚úÖ All checks have passed

# 4. ONLY after CI passes, create and push tag
git tag -a v1.3.0 -m "Release v1.3.0

üöÄ Major Release: Cross-Platform Build Infrastructure & Universal Shell Integration

Key Features:
- Complete cross-compilation toolchain setup
- Universal bash wrapper for all platforms
- Automated build pipeline with distribution packaging
- Static Linux builds for maximum compatibility"

git push origin v1.3.0

# 5. Tag push triggers full automated release pipeline:
# - GitHub release creation
# - Cargo publishing (if CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN available)
# - Homebrew tap update (if HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN available)
# - Container image publishing
```

**CRITICAL PATTERN: Never Tag Before CI Passes**
```bash
# WRONG - This can cause failed releases:
git tag v1.3.0 && git push origin v1.3.0  # DON'T DO THIS

# RIGHT - Wait for CI validation:
git push origin develop                    # Push first
# Wait for ‚úÖ GitHub Actions success
git tag v1.3.0 && git push origin v1.3.0  # Then tag
```

**GitHub Actions Pipeline (Enhanced)**:
```yaml
# Smart trigger system:
# - Every push/PR: Quality gates (test, clippy, format)
# - Push to main/develop: + Cross-platform builds + Security audit
# - Tag push (v*): + Release pipeline with publishing

# Enhanced pipeline handles:
# 1. Quality Gates: 79 tests, formatting, linting, security audit
# 2. Cross-Platform Builds: Linux musl, macOS aarch64, Windows MSVC
# 3. Universal Wrapper: Single bash script for all platforms
# 4. Release Pipeline: GitHub releases, Cargo publishing, distribution packages
# 5. Graceful Handling: Missing secrets, build failures, clear errors
```

### **üîß Phase 3: Maintenance & Monitoring (Enhanced)**

**Ongoing Maintenance Tasks:**
```bash
# 1. Keep dependencies current
cargo update && cargo audit         # Security and dependency updates
cargo test                         # Validate after updates (79 tests)

# 2. Maintain cross-compilation toolchain
brew update && brew upgrade musl-cross mingw-w64 cmake
rustup update                      # Keep Rust toolchain current

# 3. Monitor CI/CD pipeline
# - Check GitHub Actions for failures: https://github.com/holdennguyen/aws-assume-role/actions
# - Review automated releases: https://github.com/holdennguyen/aws-assume-role/releases
# - Monitor package manager publishing
# - Validate cross-platform builds

# 4. Documentation maintenance
# - Keep README.md current with features
# - Update DEPLOYMENT.md for new installation methods
# - Maintain memory-bank/ for AI context
# - Update release notes for each version
```

**GitHub Actions Monitoring:**
```bash
# Check workflow status
gh run list --limit 5              # Recent runs (requires gh auth login)

# Monitor specific workflow
gh run watch                       # Watch current run

# View failed run details
gh run view <run-id> --log         # Detailed logs for debugging
```

## üéØ Critical Development Patterns (Enhanced v1.3.0)

### **CRITICAL: Safe Release Pattern (NEW)**
```bash
# The ONLY safe way to release:
# 1. Prepare release locally
./scripts/release.sh prepare X.Y.Z

# 2. Push to develop and WAIT for CI
git add . && git commit -m "üîñ Prepare release vX.Y.Z"
git push origin develop

# 3. Check GitHub Actions status
# Visit: https://github.com/holdennguyen/aws-assume-role/actions
# Wait for ‚úÖ All checks have passed

# 4. ONLY after CI success, create tag
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
git push origin vX.Y.Z

# 5. Tag triggers automated release pipeline
```

### **CRITICAL: Cross-Compilation Toolchain Pattern**
```bash
# Complete toolchain setup required for consistent builds
# 1. Install native tools
brew install musl-cross mingw-w64 cmake

# 2. Add Rust targets
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu

# 3. Configure linkers in .cargo/config.toml
[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-musl]
linker = "x86_64-linux-musl-gcc"

[target.x86_64-pc-windows-gnu]
linker = "x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc"

# 4. Set environment variables for cross-compilation
export CC_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl=x86_64-linux-musl-gcc
export AR_x86_64_unknown_linux_musl=x86_64-linux-musl-ar
export CC_x86_64_pc_windows_gnu=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc
export AR_x86_64_pc_windows_gnu=x86_64-w64-mingw32-ar

# 5. Build with specific targets
cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
cargo build --release  # Native macOS build
```

### **Universal Wrapper Development Pattern**
```bash
# Single wrapper script approach (major simplification from v1.2.x)
# File: releases/aws-assume-role-bash.sh

# Platform detection pattern:
case "$(uname -s)" in
    Linux*)   binary_path="./aws-assume-role-linux" ;;
    Darwin*)  binary_path="./aws-assume-role-macos" ;;
    MINGW*|MSYS*|CYGWIN*) binary_path="./aws-assume-role-windows.exe" ;;
esac

# Role assumption pattern with eval:
eval $($binary_path assume "$2" "${@:3}" --format export 2>/dev/null)

# Testing pattern for universal wrapper:
source ./releases/aws-assume-role-bash.sh
awsr --version                     # Test alias
awsr list                         # Test functionality
```

### **CRITICAL: Code Formatting Pattern**
```bash
# This pattern has been observed multiple times in CI failures:
# 1. Developer makes code changes
# 2. Forgets to run cargo fmt
# 3. CI fails with formatting violations
# 4. Must fix and re-commit

# SOLUTION: Always format after ANY code change
cargo fmt                          # After every edit session
git add . && git commit            # Never commit unformatted code
```

### **Enhanced Testing Pattern (79 Tests)**
```bash
# Comprehensive test suite structure:
# - 23 unit tests (src/lib.rs, src/main.rs)
# - 14 integration tests (tests/integration_tests.rs)
# - 19 shell integration tests (tests/shell_integration_tests.rs)
# - 23 additional tests (common utilities)

# Cross-platform testing requirements:
#[cfg(test)]
use serial_test::serial;

#[test]
#[serial]
fn test_cross_platform() {
    std::env::set_var("HOME", "/tmp/test");           # Unix
    std::env::set_var("USERPROFILE", "C:\\tmp\\test"); # Windows
    // Test logic here
}

# Shell integration testing pattern:
# Tests now validate single universal wrapper instead of multiple shells
# Focus on cross-platform binary discovery and error handling
# Verify role assumption with eval and --format export
```
