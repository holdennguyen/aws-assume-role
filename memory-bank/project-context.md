# üìã Project Context

Complete project overview, current status, and active development context for AWS Assume Role CLI.

## üéØ Project Brief

### **Core Mission**
AWS Assume Role CLI is a cross-platform command-line tool that simplifies AWS role assumption for developers and DevOps teams. It provides a unified interface for managing temporary AWS credentials across different shells and environments.

### **Primary Goals**
1. **Simplify Role Assumption**: Replace complex AWS CLI commands with simple, memorable commands
2. **Cross-Platform Support**: Work seamlessly on Linux, macOS, and Windows
3. **Shell Integration**: Provide native integration for Bash, Zsh, PowerShell, Fish, and CMD
4. **Enterprise Ready**: Support package managers and enterprise deployment scenarios
5. **Security First**: Follow AWS security best practices and maintain audit trails

### **Target Users**
- **Developers**: Need to switch between AWS roles for different projects
- **DevOps Engineers**: Manage multiple AWS accounts and environments
- **Security Teams**: Require auditable and controlled access to AWS resources
- **Enterprise IT**: Need standardized tools for AWS access management

## üéØ Product Context

### **Problem Statement**

**Current Pain Points**:
- AWS CLI role assumption is verbose and error-prone
- Different syntax required for different shells
- No centralized role management
- Temporary credentials are difficult to manage
- Cross-platform inconsistencies

**Example of Current Complexity**:
```bash
# Current AWS CLI approach (complex)
aws sts assume-role \
  --role-arn "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/ProductionRole" \
  --role-session-name "my-session" \
  --duration-seconds 3600 \
  --query 'Credentials.[AccessKeyId,SecretAccessKey,SessionToken]' \
  --output text

# Extract and export credentials manually
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..."
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..."
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="..."
```

**Our Solution**:
```bash
# AWS Assume Role CLI (simple)
awsr assume production
# Automatically exports credentials to current shell
```

### **Core Value Propositions**

1. **Simplicity**: One command replaces complex AWS CLI operations
2. **Consistency**: Same experience across all platforms and shells
3. **Productivity**: Faster role switching and credential management
4. **Safety**: Built-in validation and error handling
5. **Flexibility**: Configurable for different organizational needs

### **User Experience Goals**

**For Developers**:
- Switch roles in seconds, not minutes
- Remember simple role names, not complex ARNs
- Work the same way in any shell or environment
- Get clear error messages when something goes wrong

**For Organizations**:
- Standardize AWS access patterns across teams
- Deploy through existing package management systems
- Integrate with existing security and audit processes
- Maintain centralized role definitions

## üöÄ Current Status & Active Context

- ‚úÖ **Security**: All vulnerabilities resolved, modern cryptography

### **Recent Major Achievements**

**Windows Compatibility Breakthrough (v1.2.0)**:
- Resolved all Windows-specific test failures
- Enhanced cross-platform environment variable handling
- Improved integration test coverage for Windows scenarios
- Fixed JSON parsing issues in Windows integration tests

**Testing Framework Maturity**:
- 59 comprehensive tests (14 unit + 23 integration + 22 shell integration)
- 100% test success rate across all platforms
- Automated CI/CD pipeline with zero-tolerance quality gates
- Cross-platform testing on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS

**Security Upgrade**:
- Migrated to AWS SDK v1.x with `aws-lc-rs` cryptographic backend
- Resolved all ring vulnerabilities (RUSTSEC-2025-0009, RUSTSEC-2025-0010)
- Implemented FIPS-ready cryptography
- Clean security audit results

### **Active Development Focus**

**Current Priorities**:
1. **Documentation Consolidation**: Reducing complexity and improving developer experience
2. **Release Process Optimization**: Streamlining version management and distribution
3. **User Experience Enhancement**: Based on community feedback and usage patterns
4. **Performance Optimization**: Maintaining fast startup times and efficient operations

**Next Sprint Goals**:
- Complete documentation consolidation (17 ‚Üí 8 files)
- Enhance release automation
- Improve error messages and user guidance
- Expand package manager support

### **Key Technical Decisions**

**Architecture Choices**:
- **Rust Language**: For performance, safety, and cross-platform compatibility
- **AWS CLI Integration**: Leverage existing AWS CLI rather than reimplementing
- **Shell Wrapper Strategy**: Platform-specific scripts for optimal integration
- **Configuration Management**: JSON-based user configuration with sensible defaults

**Quality Standards**:
- **Zero Clippy Warnings**: Enforced by CI pipeline
- **Mandatory Formatting**: All code must pass `cargo fmt --check`
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 59 tests covering all functionality
- **Cross-Platform Validation**: Every change tested on multiple platforms

### **Critical Patterns & Learnings**

**CRITICAL PATTERN: Formatting After Code Changes**
- ANY code modification requires immediate `cargo fmt` application
- CI has zero tolerance for formatting violations
- Pattern observed in multiple CI failure cycles
- Must be documented and enforced in development workflow

**Cross-Platform Environment Variables**:
- Windows uses `USERPROFILE`, Unix uses `HOME`
- Production code must check both environment variables
- Tests require `#[serial_test::serial]` to prevent race conditions
- Integration tests must set both variables for cross-platform compatibility

**Shell Integration Complexity**:
- Each shell requires different syntax for environment variable export
- Wrapper scripts must handle error propagation correctly
- Installation scripts need platform-specific logic
- Testing requires validation of wrapper script content and structure
