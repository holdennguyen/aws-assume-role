Complete project overview, current status, and active development context for AWS Assume Role CLI.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Brief

### **Core Mission**
AWS Assume Role CLI is a cross-platform command-line tool that simplifies AWS role assumption for developers and DevOps teams. It provides a unified interface for managing temporary AWS credentials across different shells and environments.

### **Primary Goals**
1. **Simplify Role Assumption**: Replace complex AWS CLI commands with simple, memorable commands
2. **Cross-Platform Support**: Work seamlessly on Linux, macOS Apple Silicon, and Windows Git Bash
3. **Shell Integration**: Provide universal bash wrapper for consistent experience
4. **Enterprise Ready**: Support package managers and enterprise deployment scenarios
5. **Security First**: Follow AWS security best practices and maintain audit trails

### **Target Users**
- **Developers**: Need to switch between AWS roles for different projects
- **DevOps Engineers**: Manage multiple AWS accounts and environments
- **Security Teams**: Require auditable and controlled access to AWS resources
- **Enterprise IT**: Need standardized tools for AWS access management

## ðŸŽ¯ Product Context

### **Problem Statement**

**Current Pain Points**:
- AWS CLI role assumption is verbose and error-prone
- Different syntax required for different shells
- No centralized role management
- Temporary credentials are difficult to manage
- Cross-platform inconsistencies

**Example of Current Complexity**:
```bash
# Current AWS CLI approach (complex)
aws sts assume-role \
  --role-arn "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/ProductionRole" \
  --role-session-name "my-session" \
  --duration-seconds 3600 \
  --query 'Credentials.[AccessKeyId,SecretAccessKey,SessionToken]' \
  --output text

# Extract and export credentials manually
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..."
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..."
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="..."
```

**Our Solution**:
```bash
# AWS Assume Role CLI (simple)
awsr assume production
# Automatically exports credentials to current shell
```

### **Core Value Propositions**

1. **Simplicity**: One command replaces complex AWS CLI operations
2. **Consistency**: Same experience across all platforms and shells
3. **Productivity**: Faster role switching and credential management
4. **Safety**: Built-in validation and error handling
5. **Flexibility**: Configurable for different organizational needs

### **User Experience Goals**

**For Developers**:
- Switch roles in seconds, not minutes
- Remember simple role names, not complex ARNs
- Work the same way in any shell or environment
- Get clear error messages when something goes wrong

**For Organizations**:
- Standardize AWS access patterns across teams
- Deploy through existing package management systems
- Integrate with existing security and audit processes
- Maintain centralized role definitions

### **Current Architecture (v1.3.0)**

**Cross-Platform Build System**:
- **Linux**: Static musl builds (`x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`) for maximum compatibility
- **macOS**: Native Apple Silicon builds (`aarch64-apple-darwin`)
- **Windows**: MinGW cross-compilation (`x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`)
- **Universal Wrapper**: Single bash script for all platforms

**Streamlined Platform Support**:
- **Linux**: x86_64 static binary with universal bash wrapper
- **macOS**: Apple Silicon (aarch64) binary with universal bash wrapper  
- **Windows**: Git Bash support with .exe binary and universal bash wrapper

**Automated Release Pipeline**:
1. `scripts/build-releases.sh` - Cross-platform builds with proper toolchain
2. `scripts/release.sh` - Streamlined release preparation (version + notes)
3. `releases/INSTALL.sh` - Distribution installer
4. `releases/UNINSTALL.sh` - Clean uninstaller

**Documentation Structure**:
1. `README.md` - Central hub with navigation (root only)
2. `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` - Installation and deployment guide
3. `docs/DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md` - The single source of truth for the development and release lifecycle.
4. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical architecture
5. `release-notes/` - Version history (RELEASE_NOTES_v1.3.0.md)
6. `memory-bank/` - AI agent context (this directory)

**Distribution Channels (Optimized)**:
1. **Direct Binaries**: GitHub Releases with universal bash wrapper and installer
2. **Cargo**: Official Rust package registry (crates.io)
3. **Homebrew**: Personal tap for macOS/Linux developers
4. **Container Images**: GitHub Container Registry for DevOps/CI-CD

### **Key Technical Decisions (v1.3.0)**

**Cross-Compilation Strategy**:
- **Static Linux Builds**: Using musl for maximum compatibility across distributions
- **Native macOS Builds**: Apple Silicon optimized for M1/M2/M3 Macs
- **Windows MinGW**: Cross-compiled from macOS for consistent build environment
- **Universal Wrapper**: Single bash script handles platform detection and binary selection

**Architecture Choices**:
- **Rust Language**: For performance, safety, and cross-platform compatibility
- **AWS SDK for Rust**: Direct integration with AWS APIs, replacing the previous method of shelling out to the AWS CLI.
- **Universal Bash Wrapper**: Single wrapper script for all platforms (major simplification)
- **Configuration Management**: JSON-based user configuration with sensible defaults
- **Static Linking**: Reduce runtime dependencies and improve portability

**Quality Standards**:
- **Zero Clippy Warnings**: Enforced by CI pipeline
- **Mandatory Formatting**: All code must pass `cargo fmt --check`
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 79 tests covering all functionality (expanded test coverage)
- **Cross-Platform Validation**: Every change tested on multiple platforms with real toolchain

### **Critical Patterns & Learnings (Updated v1.3.0)**

**CRITICAL PATTERN: Cross-Compilation Toolchain Management**
- Complete toolchain setup required for consistent builds across platforms
- Proper linker configuration in `.cargo/config.toml` essential
- Environment variables needed for cross-compilation (CC, AR, etc.)
- Static linking (musl) preferred for Linux distribution compatibility
- Pattern: `./dev-cli.sh build` now handles all cross-platform builds.

**Universal Wrapper Pattern**:
- Single bash script more maintainable than multiple shell-specific scripts
- Platform detection with `uname -s` covers Linux, Darwin, MINGW/MSYS/CYGWIN
- Binary discovery pattern: local files first, then PATH fallback
- Error handling pattern: clear messages for unsupported OS or missing binaries
- Role assumption pattern: `eval $($binary_path assume "$2" "${@:3}" --format export)`

**CRITICAL PATTERN: The Developer CLI is Mandatory**
- ALL code modifications must be validated with `./dev-cli.sh check` before committing.
- This single command handles formatting, linting, testing, and building, preventing CI failures.

**Cross-Platform Environment Variables**:
- Windows uses `USERPROFILE`, Unix uses `HOME`
- Production code must check both environment variables
- Tests require `#[serial_test::serial]` to prevent race conditions
- Integration tests must set both variables for cross-platform compatibility

**Automation-Driven Release Workflow**:
- The release process is initiated with `./dev-cli.sh release <version>`.
- The subsequent steps are governed by the **Safe Release Process** documented in `DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md`.
- This process requires a successful CI run on the `develop` branch before a release tag can be created and pushed.

**Local Distribution Testing**:
- Use `./dev-cli.sh package <version>` to create full distributable packages locally
- This creates `.tar.gz` and `.zip` archives with checksums for end-to-end testing
- Mimics the exact artifacts that will be published in GitHub releases
